This is an implementation of the `Yubico <http://www.yubico.com/>`_ OTP
algorithm, used on `YubiKey <http://www.yubico.com/yubikey>`_ devices. The
primary audience is developers who wish to verify YubiKey tokens in their
applications, presumably as part of a multi-factor authentication scheme. Note
that this is *not* a `YubiCloud <http://www.yubico.com/yubicloud>`_ client,
it's the low-level implementation. Those wishing to verify YubiKey tokens in
their application will be most interested in `yubiotp.otp.decode_otp`.

For testing and experimenting, the included ``yubikey`` script simulates one or
more YubiKey devices using a config file. It also includes utility commands
such as a modhex converter. See ``yubikey -h`` for details.
